## A SWAPI REACT REDUX PROJECT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This configuration assumes you have installed Node 6.*.

1) Install dependecies with `npm install`<br>
2) Start the dev server and runs the app in the development mode with `npm start`<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
